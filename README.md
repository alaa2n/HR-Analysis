📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Attrition & Employee Insights
🔍 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end HR Analytics dashboard built using Power BI as part of the DEPI Scholarship final project.
The goal of the project is to analyze employee data, understand attrition patterns, and uncover key factors affecting employee satisfaction and retention.

The project explores a new domain for me — Human Resources analytics — and allowed me to apply data modeling, DAX measures, and storytelling techniques to generate actionable business insights.

📌 Key Insights

The overall Attrition Rate is ~16%, indicating a moderate-to-high employee turnover risk.

Technology and Sales departments experience the highest employee attrition.

The most impacted job roles include Software Engineers, Data Scientists, and Sales Executives.

Attrition is highest among employees aged 26–35 and those with 0–3 years of experience.

Single employees show a higher likelihood of leaving compared to married employees.

Peak attrition months are January, March, May, and August, revealing a clear seasonal pattern.

Employee satisfaction levels (Job, Environment, and Relationship) show that most employees are neutral to satisfied, but dissatisfaction still plays a role in attrition.

💡 Business Recommendations

Improve retention strategies for early-career employees through better onboarding and career development plans.

Focus on workload management and growth opportunities in high-attrition departments.

Introduce targeted engagement and retention programs before peak attrition months.

Leverage satisfaction metrics as early indicators to proactively reduce employee turnover.

🚀 Outcome

This project demonstrates my ability to translate HR data into meaningful insights and present them through interactive dashboards that support data-driven decision-making.
